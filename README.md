## What Is A DDos-Attack
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. These attacks target a wide variety of important resources, including banks, news websites, and other critical infrastructure. DDoS attacks present a major challenge to ensuring the availability and reliability of online services.

## Types of DDoS Attacks
There are several types of DDoS attacks, including:
- **Volume-Based Attacks**: These attacks aim to consume the target's bandwidth by sending a massive amount of traffic. Examples include UDP Flood, ICMP Flood, and HTTP Flood.
- **Protocol Attacks**: These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols to exhaust the target's resources. Examples include SYN Flood and Ping of Death.
- **Application Layer Attacks**: These attacks target specific applications or services running on the target server. Examples include HTTP GET/POST floods and Slowloris attacks.

## Description of This Script
This script implements a **UDP Flood** attack, which is a type of volume-based DDoS attack. It sends a large number of UDP packets to the target IP address and port, attempting to overwhelm the target system's resources.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - Creates a UDP socket.
   - Generates a random payload of 1490 bytes.
   - Prompts the user to input the target IP address and port.

2. **Attack Execution**:
   - Enters an infinite loop where it continuously sends UDP packets to the target.
   - Increments the port number after each packet, cycling through all valid ports (1â€“65534).

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the number of packets sent, the target IP, and the current port.

### Limitations
- **Bandwidth Constraints**: The attacker's internet connection speed limits the volume of traffic they can send.
- **Firewall and IDS/IPS**: Modern networks often have firewalls and IDS/IPS that can detect and block such attacks.
- **Port Increment Logic**: The script increments the port number after each packet, reducing its focus on a single port, potentially making it less effective.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Prarambha369/DDos-Attack.git
```
```sh
cd DDos-Attack
```
```sh
chmod +x ddos-attack.py
```
```sh   
python ddos-attack.py
```
## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python ddos-attack.py
    ```
2. Enter the target IP address and port when prompted.
3. The script will start sending a flood of requests to the target IP address.
4. To stop the attack, press `Ctrl + C`.
